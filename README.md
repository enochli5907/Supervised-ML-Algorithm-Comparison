An analysis and report on the Comparison of Supervised Machine Learning Methods on Binary Classification.

This is a final report for COGS 118A, Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms at UC San Diego in La Jolla, CA.

This report replicates a part of the analysis done in the paper by [Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml06.pdf).

The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/enochli5907/Supervised-ML-Algorithm-Comparison/blob/master/Final%20Report.pdf)
